# CROPPED-TEMPLATE-MATCHER-IN-AN-IMAGE
Aims to detect whether a given Image is a cropped part of a given Target Image or not using Computer Vision.

In this model, I worked on different algorithms to solve the problem and differentiating these algorithms in terms of their working.

**Algorithms used:**

- TM_CCOEFF
- TM_CCOEFF_NORMED
- TM_CCORR
- TM_CCORR_NORMED
- TM_SQDIFF
- TM_SQDIFF_NORMED
